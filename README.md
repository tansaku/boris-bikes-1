Boris Bikes
===========

This Repo contains some sample Boris Bikes code (see 'sample' branch) and is set up with [Travis Continuous Integration](https://travis-ci.org) (CI) so that tests are run automatically when any code is pushed to the repository.

The badge below shows the status of the 'build', i.e. whether the current code has any failing tests:

You can fork this repo in order to get a repository that is similarly enabled, although you will need to sign up for a TravisCI account via GitHub.  See Travis' [getting started](http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/getting-started/) guide for more details.  Having forked this repo you will have the necessary configuration files, and can just enable build tracking through the Travis web interface.
